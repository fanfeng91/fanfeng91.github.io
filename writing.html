      <h2>Experiencing the Chinese New Year, exploring diverse Chinese culture</h2>
      <article>
        <h3 class="instructor">Instructor: Dr. Colee Splichal</h3>
        <p>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (Feb. 16, 2016) – It was 7 p.m., but the University Center Lakeside Patio at the University of Miami was loaded with people --- unusual for a Monday night. Smiles filled the festive atmosphere. Around 20 white tents provided bright scenery to mark the fifth annual Lunar New Year Celebration in honor of the Year of the Monkey, Feb. 15 on the Chinese calendar.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, Asian American Students Association and Hong Kong Students Association, the Chinese Lunar New Year Celebration was divided into three parts: tent display, food supply and evening show. More than 600 people on-campus and off-campus shared the fun of recognizing the Year of the Monkey.</p>
        <p>At 6 p.m., the white tents decorated with red lanterns and colored lights opened, marking the beginning of the events. They showcased diverse Chinese cultural activities including making Chinese tea, writing in Chinese calligraphy and learning traditional Chinese paper-cut.</p>

        <p>“All the activities were amazing, and I enjoyed them a lot,” said Andres Talero, a UM senior in the College of Arts and Sciences. “I am interested in Chinese culture, and I studied in the Chinese University of Hong Kong as an exchange student last year. These activities made me miss life in China.”</p>
        <p>When participants engaged in each activity in the tents, they received a letter from the word “monkey.” Once they collected all six letters, they were invited to eat traditional Asian food.</P>
        <p>The free food was supplied at 7 p.m. in two tents. Sushi Maki’s staff offered sushi and CSSA staff offered traditional Chinese food such as rice, noodles and dumplings sponsored by the Chop Suey Restaurant. People lined up outside the tents.</P>

        <p>“The food was great, similar to authentic Chinese traditional food, especially the dumplings,”said Qi Zhang, a Chinese UM student who celebrated the Lunar New Year away from home for the first time.</P>
        <p>“The food made me feel at home, so it reduced my homesickness. I appreciated the CSSA’s holding the event.”</P>
        <p>From 8-9 p.m., guests enjoyed the show, featuring the traditional Chinese Lion Dance, acrobatic performances and traditional martial arts. Five UM students played traditional Chinese instruments and a professional acrobat balanced atop four stacked chairs. Eight Chinese students demonstrated street dances to the song “Reflection” and a Chinese pop song, which brought the evening to a tuneful climax.</p>

        <p>“The show was fantastic, even more interesting than shows in China,” said Yiying Yang, a Chinese student majoring in higher education administration. “The acrobat who could balance on top of four chairs was unbelievable. But the street dance was my favorite, especially with the Chinese pop song.”</p>
        <p>“I think it was a great and successful event,” said Zhuoying Lin, CSSA president and the main person responsible for the event. “There was a sea of people on the UC Lakeside Patio throughout the evening, especially the food supply time --- not only UM students but also people from the neighborhood participated in our event to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year.</p>
        <p>“I am very grateful to all CSSA staff for their contributions tonight.”</p>

      <h2>Garbage gets a second life in the Galapagos</h2>
      <article>
        <h3 class="instructor">Instructor: Dr. Heidi Carr</h3>
        <p>SANTA CRUZ, The Galapagos, Ecuador -- Six days a week, a small army of garbage trucks fan out across the island of Santa Cruz, collecting the rotting food, empty beer and soda cans, and dirty diapers tossed by the island’s 15,000 residents and 4,000 weekly visitors.</p>
        <p>Most of that garbage is hauled to Relleno Sanitario Landfill, located 27 kilometers north of Puerto Ayora, the main town on the island.</P>
        <p>But officials with the Santa Cruz Environmental Management Department say that nearly 40 percent of the island’s annual 5,105 tons of garbage is getting a second go-round, rather than piling up at the landfill.</p>
        <p>“Some materials could be reused directly after recycling,” Marcos Carrillo, the coordinator of the Fabricio Valverde Recycling Center, said in Spanish. “For example, the dried organic garbage is sold to farmers.”</p>
        <p>In 2003, a municipal law was passed in the Galapagos Islands that for the first time would help protect the environment. Three years later, a system was initiated, requiring all residents, hotels, restaurants and stories to separate their garbage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Organic: Fruit peels, vegetables and cut-up wood;</li>
          <li>Recyclables: Paper, cardboard, plastic, cans and batteries;</li>
          <li>Non-recyclables: Toilet paper, old clothes, diapers, razors and water filters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But change comes slowly in the Galapagos, and it wasn’t until 2015 that the government set out different colored garbage bins — green for organic, blue for recyclables and black for recyclables — in public places, like outside the airport on Baltra Island and dotting the harbor in downtown Puerto Ayora, making the system visible to visitors.</p>
        <img src="images/G1.jpg" alt="G1" />
        <p>In March 2016, the most recent time period data is available, nearly 140 tons of recyclable garbage as sorted and taken to the recycling center just outside of Puerto Ayora, the largest town on the island.</p>
        <p>There, 12-member crews work six days a week. After the garbage is dumped from the trucks onto a conveyor belt, workers wearing protective masks and gloves separate the paper from the plastics, the glass from the cans. Caps are taken off plastic bottles so that machinery can press the plastic bottles more easily later down the assembly line.</p>
        <img src="images/G2.jpg" alt="G2" />
        <p>They also need to separate glass according to color – clear, brown or green – and grind them. Later the ground glass will be mixed with cement to make paving stones.</p>
        <p>Nearby, workers sort through the green bins holding organic material. They toss the plastic bags, then spray what’s left with a disinfectant.</p>
        <p>This will be sold to local farmers for $5 per 100 pounds, Carillo said.</p>
        <p>While some of the larger recyclable items, like corrugated cardboard, are put on a ship for the five-day journey back to mainland Ecuador for processing, many of the smaller items are put back to use immediately by the local shopkeepers and artisans.</p>
        <p>For example, pages of magazines are folded and glued to make small bags for tourists to put their trinkets. Pieces of wood are carved into miniature sea turtles and sea lions.</p>
        <p>In order for the recycling efforts to work, the community has to be behind it, said Mario Piu, a biologist and the director of the Environmental Management Department on Santa Cruz.</p>
        <p>“We are promoting the ‘4R’ principles -- recycle, reduction, reuse and rejection — in Galapagos,” Piu said in Spanish. “The biggest challenge for us is not the process of recycling, it’s how to change people’s minds in order to respect the environment and consume responsibly.”</p>
        <p>A major incentive to get residents and business owners to comply, Piu said, is imposing fines.</p>
        <p>Said Piu: “Everyone in the island has the responsibility to recycle, but we still need more funding and other support to promote the recycling.”</p>
